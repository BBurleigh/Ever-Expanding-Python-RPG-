# Ever Expanding - A Terminal-Based RPG by Brayden Burleigh

## The Story
Once upon a time, the world was a vast, wonderful, and chaotic place. The diversity and complexity of life and the land was both breathtaking and overwhelming. From the inverted waterfalls of the Cherubi Mountains to the bioluminescent jungles of the Deep Dark, many people found inspiration, adventure, and homes in this unusual biomes.

Life was not perfect. Everyone did not get along. Some had things easier than others. Despite this, to varying degrees, each person treasured something about their wonderful and difficult world.

However, there was one person who hated the world. The diversity, complexity, and challenges of life frightened this individual to no end. One day, they cast a curse. This curse eroded away the world and quashed everything into a simple, predictable, and linear strip of land.

You awaken at the edge of a plain, unaware of any of this. Your only inclination is to head east and figure out what to do from there.

## What is in this Game (so far)
As of May 13th, 2024, this is what is present in the game:
- A homescreen, credits, bestiary, game information pages
- Three playable characters
- A linear world map
- A way to interact with the world (go east/west, investigate)
- A combat system
- A handful of opponents
- One main quest
- Useable and (later) crafting items

## Plans for the Next Update
- An expanded world map 
- A leveling system
- Unlockable skills based on each character and their level
- Three or four side quests
- A few more biomes/locations and a few more opponents

## Long-Term Goals
- Have a full and playable game (complete storyline, a solid number of side quests, equipment, secrets, and more)
- Have more efficient code for the game (modularization, better written functions and constructors, etc.)
- Combat against more than one enemy (up to three foes)
- A more unique combat system in regards to opponents and their choice of actions
- Stacking the same items to save inventory space 
- Crude graphics for combat, backgrounds for different locations, and maybe important characters
- A working crafting system
- Saving files and loading save files
- A customizable character of the player's choice

## Purpose of this Project
In an effort to learn and better my skills with Python, I have created this project as a fun way to keep myself engaged in the learning process. A friend of mine, who is a very skilled software enginner and has helped me along the way, encouraged me that the best way to learn something is to start by creating something.

And echoing his words, I encourage others to do this same. Find something that you enjoy or are passionate about, and create some form of app or game based around that. Research and use tutorial videos during the process, and the learning will be more meaningful.

## How to Play the Game
1. Download and open the files into Visual Studios Code (unsure of how it'll work outside of VS Code)
2. Make sure you have at least Python version 3.11.4
3. Go to game_engine.py 
4. Run the code from this file (and enjoy)

## Contributions
Though this is primarily a project written and tested by myself, there are a few key people whose support I highly appreciate. First is my partner, who was denied plenty of headrubs and very patient with me as I worked on this project. Second is my friend, who has elaborately answered my questions and provided many resources despite his busy schedule.
